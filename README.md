# Employee-Database-Design-with-EER-Diagrams-Schema-Creation-and-Relationship-Management
### Attatchments: MySQL Workbench File
In this lab, I designed an Employee database schema using Enhanced Entity-Relationship (EER) diagrams. This project involved creating essential entities such as Employee, Department, Dept_Emp, Dept_Manager, Title, and Salary, each with specific attributes, primary keys, and foreign key constraints to ensure data integrity.

Using MySQL Workbench, I started by configuring the properties of each table, carefully defining the data types and constraints. For instance, the Emp_No attribute serves as a primary key in the Employee table and as a foreign key in both the Title and Salary tables, establishing clear relationships across entities.

I defined various relationships between the tables, emphasizing the one-to-many relationships, such as between Employee and Title, where a single employee can hold multiple titles throughout their career. This reinforced my understanding of cardinality and its implications for database design.

Additionally, I delved into the concepts of identifying and non-identifying relationships. By adjusting the types of relationships and establishing foreign key constraints, I ensured referential integrity across the database. This included managing weak entities and their total existence dependency on strong entities, which enhanced my ability to model complex data scenarios.

This lab not only sharpened my technical skills in database design and management but also solidified my understanding of critical database concepts, such as normalization, entity relationships, and data integrity. The hands-on experience with MySQL Workbench allowed me to translate theoretical knowledge into practical application, preparing me for future challenges in database management and design.
